"""Neural spline flow builder for the NPE density estimator.

:func:`build_nsf` stacks rational-quadratic spline coupling transforms, each followed by an LU
linear layer, on a standard-normal base conditioned on the embedding net's output.
:class:`ContextSplineMap` is the spline conditioner for a one-dimensional target, where
coupling has nothing else to condition on. Adapted from ``sbi``.
